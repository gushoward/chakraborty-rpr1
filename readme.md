## Abstract

Chakraborty (2021) examines the relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and the percentage of people with disabilities across U.S. counties, considering socio-demographic factors like race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and sex. Using bivariate correlations and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, the study finds significant positive associations between COVID-19 rates and socially vulnerable populations. This reproduction study aims to verify Chakrabortyâ€™s findings for policy, research, and educational purposes by replicating all analyses, including county-level COVID-19 distributions, statistical correlations, and GEE models. The data and code are publicly available on GitHub, ensuring transparency and accessibility for further study.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
- Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
- Results: [results/results_index.csv](results/results_index.csv)

Important local **documents** include:
- Pre-analysis plan: [docs/report/preanalysis.pdf](docs/report/preanalysis.pdf)
- Study report: [docs/report/report.pdf](docs/report/report.pdf)
