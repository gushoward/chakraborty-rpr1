### Abstract

Chakraborty (2021) examines the relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and the percentage of people with disabilities across U.S. counties, considering socio-demographic factors like race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and sex. Using bivariate correlations and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, the study finds significant positive associations between COVID-19 rates and socially vulnerable populations. This reproduction study aims to verify Chakrabortyâ€™s findings for policy, research, and educational purposes by replicating all analyses, including county-level COVID-19 distributions, statistical correlations, and GEE models. The data and code are publicly available on GitHub, ensuring transparency and accessibility for further study.


This is a reproduction study of 'Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. Disability and Health Journal 14:1-5. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007.'

The goeal of the replication is to understand the links between race/ethnicity and disability and COVID-19 rates.

## Study design

This is a reproduction study to understand the links between race/ethnicity and disability and COVID-19 rates.

## Materials and procedure

### Computational environment

I will use the R version 4.4.2 with the following packages: "tidycensus", "tidyverse", "downloader", "sf", "classInt", "readr",
  "here", "s2", "pastecs", "tmap", "SpatialEpi", "svDialogs",
  "geepack", "knitr", "kableExtra", "foreign", "broom", "dotwhisker", "dotenv"

### Data and variables

Metadat for the two data sources can be found at https://github.com/gushoward/chakraborty-rpr1/blob/main/data/metadata/metadata_covid.xml and https://github.com/gushoward/chakraborty-rpr1/blob/main/data/metadata/metadata_acs.xml. 


### Data transformations

Initial Study does not include Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. Data on people with disabilities in poverty is derived from a different census table (C18130) than data on people with disabilities and age, race, ethnicity, age, and biological sex (S1810). 

The COVID-19 data includes an estimate of the total population (POP_ESTIMA) and confirmed COVID-19 cases (Confirmed). The COVID-19 case data expresses cumulative count of reported COVID-19 from 1/22/2020 to 8/1/2020. Versions of the data can be found at the John Hopkins CCSE COVID-19 Data Repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Discussion

The aim of this reproduction is to further measure the relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and various demographic variables. The analysis will map the dispersal of COVID distribution at the county level, as well as using a Kulldorf statistics for relative risk mapping of COVID rates. This work can do well to influence policy and high-level decision making when it comes to at risk populations.
