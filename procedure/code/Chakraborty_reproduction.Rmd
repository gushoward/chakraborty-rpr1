# Abstract

Chakraborty (2021) examines the relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and the percentage of people with disabilities across U.S. counties, considering socio-demographic factors like race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and sex. Using bivariate correlations and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, the study finds significant positive associations between COVID-19 rates and socially vulnerable populations. This reproduction study aims to verify Chakrabortyâ€™s findings for policy, research, and educational purposes by replicating all analyses, including county-level COVID-19 distributions, statistical correlations, and GEE models. The data and code are publicly available on GitHub, ensuring transparency and accessibility for further study.

## Keywords
COVID-19, Race, Disability

## Study Design

This is a reproduction study to understand the links between race/ethnicity and disability and COVID-19 rates.
